hi Rachel,
yes, great to do goodreads; pls dont upload ms word; either dofile, txt, or pdf!; also no data in github
--only code (dofiles) or writeups (pdf or txt), and the code (dofile) should load data from online!; 
comments on first abstract: looks good--and you can still do it as an addition to goodreads--there is a lot of great data at 
country level and it is also easy to merge (ps2 and ps3); goodreads sounds great--i know dan is pushing r; but
you can just stay with stata, or i'd actually recommend python--it would also allow you to get data straight from goodreads--
if you were interested, pls see:
